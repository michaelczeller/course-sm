## Framing - definition and origins

- broadly, **[framing]{style="color:darkred;"}** refers to the meanings individuals or groups attach to events, developments, activities, and other individuals/groups.
    + previously, this had also been covered by referring to **[ideology]{style="color:cadetblue;"}**

\vspace{5mm}

- origins of '[framing]{style="color:darkred;"}': Erving Goffman's *Frame Analysis* (1974)
    + frames link **[objective conditions]{style="color:violet;"}** to **[subjective perceptions]{style="color:violet;"}**
- Benford and Snow (1986) connect this concept to social movements
    + how do collective actors collectively determine *what's going on here* --- and once they make that determination, how do they try to convince others?

## Framing - why? 

- Is there a problem?
- Can it be fixed?
- How can it be fixed?
- What must be done?

- **[Frames provide answers to these questions]{style="color:cadetblue;"}---they are essential to movement activity**

## Framing - why?

- Is there a problem?
- Can it be fixed?
- How can it be fixed?
- What must be done?

- **[Frames provide answers to these questions]{style="color:cadetblue;"}---they are essential to movement activity**

- types of **[frames]{style="color:darkred;"}**: 
    + *[diagnostic]{style="color:darkred;"}*: what's the problem and who's to blame
    + *[prognostic]{style="color:darkred;"}*: how can the problem be solved
    + *[motivational]{style="color:darkred;"}*: why should we go solve this problem

## Framing - an example

- types of **[frames]{style="color:darkred;"}**: *[diagnostic]{style="color:darkred;"}*: what's the problem and who's to blame; *[prognostic]{style="color:darkred;"}*: how can the problem be solved; *[motivational]{style="color:darkred;"}*: why should we go solve this problem

*deaths from drunk driving*

- previously, 'just' sad, but bound to happen, like other [accidents]{style="color:seagreen;"}

. . . 

- But then (re-)framed:
    + Some [immoral person]{style="color:violet;"} drank and drove 
    + People should not drive drunk
    + It is not [fair]{style="color:violet;"} for a person to die because of another's immorality

. . . 

- [Examples from cases you know: how do movements frame issues?]{style="color:indigo;"}

## Injustice frames (Gamson, 2013)

- When impersonal, abstract forces are perceived as responsible for problems/wrongs/suffering, people tend to accept, tolerate, and cope

. . . 

BUT...

. . . 

- When problems/wrongs/suffering are attributed to individuals' or groups' *ignorance*, *indifference*, or *malice*, the result is a **[sense of injustice]{style="color:darkred;"}**

. . . 

Injustice frames are often the core of **[diagnosing]{style="color:darkred;"}** issues that movements care about

## Further types of frames

- **[Master frame]{style="color:darkred;"}**: an overarching frame that smaller/sub-issue frames fit into
    + e.g., the '[Great Replacement]{style="color:goldenrod;"}'
        * can accommodate subordinate frames about welfare provision, ethno-cultural identity, maintaining liberal democracy, religious heritage and/or freedom, etc.

## Further types of frames 

- **[Counter frame]{style="color:darkred;"}**: a frame created to oppose another group's frame [cf. @Mayer1995; @Meyer1996; @Meyer2008]
    + e.g., abortion contention in the U.S.:
        * one side: '*pro-choice*', freedom to choose to abort or not 
        * other side: 'where is the baby's *choice*? (rights of unborn) 

## Further types of frames 

- **[Counter frame]{style="color:darkred;"}**: a frame created to oppose another group's frame [cf. @Mayer1995; @Meyer1996; @Meyer2008]
    + e.g., abortion contention in the U.S.:
        * one side: '*pro-choice*', freedom to choose to abort or not 
        * other side: 'where is the baby's *choice*? (rights of unborn) 
        * one side: women's *right* 
        * other side: *regret* of women who have aborted 

. . . 

- '[framing contest]{style="color:darkred;"}' -- which frame is doing better among opposing movements
    + this is [traceable]{style="color:blue;"}/[measureable]{style="color:blue;"} in different arenas: mass media, political debates, court cases, etc.

## Framing contest (Alex Wong, Getty Images)

![](slide_files/03/abortion_frames.png)

[other examples?]{style="color:indigo;"}

## Frame alignment [@Benford2000]

- **[frame bridging]{style="color:darkred;"}** - linking of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem
    + e.g., German activists against World Bank and IMF, linking their frames to those of peace, ecosystem, women's, localism, and labour movements
- **[frame amplification]{style="color:darkred;"}** - idealization, embellishment, clarification, or invigoration of existing values or beliefs
    + e.g., white supremacists stressing 'white *pride*' or preserving white race (e.g., 14 words)

## Frame alignment [@Benford2000]

- **[frame extension]{style="color:darkred;"}** - depicting an SMO’s interests and frame(s) as extending beyond its primary interests to include issues and concerns that are presumed to be of importance to potential adherents
    + e.g., peace movement: money spent on military could be used for education, infrastructure, social programmes, etc. --- so groups that want more funding are potential recruits
- **[frame transformation]{style="color:darkred;"}** - changing old understandings and meanings and/or generating new ones
    + e.g., drunk driving example: accident &rarr; moral failing

## Frame resonance [@Benford2000]

> [resonance]{style="color:darkred;"} - degree to which a movement's framing aligns with beliefs, values, experiences of consituents/audience/public

- **[Credibility]{style="color:cadetblue;"}**:
    + *[consistency]{style="color:forestgreen;"}* - congruency of SMO’s beliefs, claims, and actions
        * e.g., [do Klima-Kleber actions align with claims]{style="color:indigo;"}?
    + *[empirical credibility]{style="color:forestgreen;"}* - can claims be verified
        * e.g., climate change: complex, but measurable and traceable
    + *[credibility of claim-maker]{style="color:forestgreen;"}* - are the movement actors (esp. leaders) seen as reliable, knowledgeable, respectable
        * e.g., we should listen to Einstein and Sakharov about nuclear disarmament because they understand how the bombs work

## Frame resonance [@Benford2000]

> [resonance]{style="color:darkred;"} - degree to which a movement's framing aligns with beliefs, values, experiences of consituents/audience/public

- **[Salience]{style="color:cadetblue;"}**:
    + *[centrality]{style="color:forestgreen;"}* - does it **matter** to potential members/participants?
    + *[experiential commensurability]{style="color:forestgreen;"}* - does it fit with the experience of potential members/participants? 
    + *[narrative fidelity]{style="color:forestgreen;"}* - does it accord with wider cultural narratives/traditions?

## Introducing concept of civil society

- **[civil society]{style="color:darkred;"}**: organised (non-state, non-market) societal activity <!-- apart from state and market spheres -->
    + composed of *[voluntary association]{style="color:cadetblue;"}* based on *[shared interests]{style="color:cadetblue;"}*
    + fuzzy conceptual boundaries
    + *Bolleyer*: voluntary members, non-profit, private, self-governing, formalised infrastructure

- Alexis de Tocqueville: **[free association]{style="color:darkorange;"}** essential for democracy

. . . 

- other perspectives on **[civil society]{style="color:darkred;"}** concept: 
    + [social contract theory]{style="color:seagreen;"}: surrender of (some) freedom for civil(ised) society --- escaping 'state of nature'
    + [Marxian]{style="color:seagreen;"}: dissolution of civil society in favour of state
    + [Gramscian]{style="color:seagreen;"}: part of arena for battling for *cultural hegemony*

## Larry Diamond on civil society and democracy (until 2.20): {.smaller}

<!-- Aspect ratios include 1x1, 4x3, 16x9 (the default), and 21x9. -->

. . . 

- (i) monitoring government performance; (ii) mobilising political participation (voting is bare minimum---democracy needs more engagement); (iii) force [parties] to become more democratic internally; (iv) form coalitions to push through reforms

*so lots of parallels with conceptions of [social movement sector]{style="color:red;"}*

## Civil society and democracy

- organisational participation (contributing to [democratic citizenry]{style="color:seagreen;"})
- interest representation (similar function to [parties]{style="color:seagreen;"})
- societal responsiveness (alternative mechanism of [political input]{style="color:seagreen;"})

## @Berman1997 - Civil society in Weimar - theory

- Tocqueville
    + neo-Tocquevillian scholars: Putnam's focus on community and social capital (e.g., *Bowling Alone*)
        * **[associationism]{style="color:darkorange;"}** both indicator of healthy democracy and prerequisite for it
- W. Kornhauser, H. Arendt: '[mass society]{style="color:cadetblue;"}' (collapse of intermediate associations)
    + industrialisation and modernity estranged citizens from each other --- lack of *belonging*

## Theory puzzle

- neo-Tocquevillean theories:
    + high levels of associationism = good for democracy
- Huntingtonian institutionalist theories:
    + without high **[political institutionalisation]{style="color:darkorange;"}**, active and mobilised citizenry degenerates into instability, disorder, and even violence

<!-- “Yet in contrast to what neo-Tocquevillean theories would predict, high levels of associationism, absent strong and responsive national government and political parties, served to fragment rather than unite German society. It was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during the Wilhelmine and Weimar eras” ([Berman, 1997, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/TJAKENM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AW2W2AME?page=3&annotation=G64QGL5H)) THESIS SUMMARY -->

<!-- “As Samuel Huntington noted almost three decades ago, societies with highly active and mobilized publics and low levels of political institutionalization often degenerate into instability, disorder, and even violence” ([Berman, 1997, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/TJAKENM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AW2W2AME?page=3&annotation=LXZK9VKX)) THEORY PUZZLE -->

## Types of puzzles [@day2019FindingQuestion] {.smaller .scrollable}

- [Empirical puzzles]{style="color:blue;"}
    + Contra expectations - against conventional wisdom or theoretical expectation
        * e.g., Soviet liberalisation and disintegration---no one expected it!
    + Divergence/convergence - (D) multiple cases that look similar experience different outcomes; (C) multiple cases that look different experience the same outcome
        * e.g., (D) post-Soviet transition – looks the same, but... 
        * e.g., (C) third wave of democratisation - Portugal, Latin America, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan
    + Variation over time - conditions appear stable but suddenly change
        * e.g., Mugabe ouster (in power 37 years, 1980-2017)---all seemed stable...
        
- [Theoretical puzzles]{style="color:blue;"}
    + Conceptual omission - necessary concept missing from theoretical framework
        * e.g., private agents in repressive action (Jennifer Earl, social control)
    + Theoretical convergence - one body of literature weighs in on another
        * e.g., @Schock2005: non-violence theory to modify social movement theory
        * e.g., 'Punctuated equilibrium' (evolutionary biology) used in institutionalism
    + Squaring the circle - contradictory theoretical arguments against each other

- [Methodological puzzles]{style="color:blue;"}
    + Measurement - new way to measure a concept <!-- (e.g., Steven Pinker) -->
        * e.g., Steven Pinker - human society is getting better (new groupings and collection of data to measure; estimated numbers on violent deaths globally, over time)
    + Technique - applying a new method <!-- (e.g., QCA to democratisation studies) -->
        * e.g., QCA to studies of democratisation (necessary and sufficient conditions)
        * @russett1967PearlHarborDeterrence single (deviant) case study in IR, Pearl Harbour disputing Deterrence Theory in favour of Decision Theory


## Contextual background - *Wilhelmine Germany*

- various spurts of associational growth in 19th and early 20th century
    + legal liberalisation, expanding wealth (rise of bourgeoisie), universal suffrage granted --- BUT...
    + failure of liberal political parties to aggregate interests and bolster institutional politics
    + economic deprivation
        * trend of associations emerging in response to strain
        * nationalist/anti-democratic actors targeted dissatisfied for recruitment

## Casing

- [influential/crucial case]{style="color:blue;"} [@Gerring2007]
    + Weimar as 'crucial theoretical testing ground'
    + (Wilhelmine) Germany as comparable to U.S. for high level of associationalism (*Vereinsmeierei*)

## Civil society in Weimar

> What occurred in Germany was no less than an [inversion of neo-Tocquevillean theory]{style="color:cadetblue;"}; not only did participation in **[civil society organizations fail to contribute to republican virtue]{style="color:darkorange;"}**, but it in fact **[subverted it]{style="color:darkorange;"}**. ... Private associations were correctly seen to offer benefits that the traditional bourgeois parties were failing to provide, such as a sense of community and unity. (p417)

## Findings

- "*It was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem...*" <!-- during the Wilhelmine and Weimar eras. -->
- NSDAP rise: not through attracting apolitical Germans---instead, attracting highly active individuals [&darr;]{style="color:red;"} <!-- &#8628; --> <!-- $\downarrow$  -->
    + expand party's appeal and consolidate position


> Civil society activity alone, in short, could not overcome the country's social divisions or provide the political cohesion that would have been necessary to weather the crises which beset Germany beginning in 1914. For this, strong and flexible political institutions, particularly political parties, were necessary.
