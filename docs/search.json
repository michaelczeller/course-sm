How and why do people engage in collective action? In what ways do they organise and mobilise? What tactics and strategies do they use? How do movements succeed—and how do they fail? This course will introduce students to the scholarship that addresses these questions. We will draw on literature about social movements generally and about specific movement cases, especially (but not exclusively) in Germany. Students will acquire detailed knowledge about the theories guiding past and present social movement research as well as expertise about specific cases of social movement activity."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe far-right phenomenon in Germany is frequently discussed in media and public discourse. Far-right agitation can take various forms: the far right is organisationally diverse, encompassing parties, movements, movement-parties, groupuscules, networks, lone actors and more (Castelli Gattinara & Pirro, 2018). In Germany, much scholarly attention has been directed towards the realm of far-right party politics; much less towards smaller-scale right-wing extremist incidents.\n\nThis data report aims to provide an overview of different types of activities assigned to a far-right ideology in a specific regional and temporal context. By focusing on these activities rather than individual parties or groups, this study seeks to identify symptomatic behaviours and incipient processes of radicalisation. In particular, this report draws on data from Bavaria, especially Munich.\nThe Antifaschistische Informations-, Dokumentations- und Archivstelle München e. V. (a.i.d.a.) provides a detailed chronology of incidents of far-right activity in Bavaria. This report draws on the last twelve months of this chronology, encompassing all listed incidents, including minor actions such as pasting far-right stickers. (Such minor incidents may be significant, for example indicating the presence of a far-right group or individual in a particular area.)\nThe report is structured as follows: first, it briefly discusses some theoretical foundations. Then, it outlines the development of the far-right in Bavaria after 1945. Next, it introduces the data, including novel coding work. The report discusses what the data show and concludes by summarising and discussing possible limitations."

    "text": "The far right in Germany and Bavaria\nIn the post-war era, far-right activity has been present in Bavaria, manifesting in different forms and intensities over time (cf. Pfahl-Traughber 2019). This overview aims to provide context for the data by examining the development of far-right structures in the region.\nHere, the term right-wing terrorism refers to violent acts committed with a racist or anti-Semitic motive, linked to central far-right ideological tenets (nationalism, exclusionism, xenophobia, nativism, authoritarianism and populism, Mudde 2019). Incidents of right-wing terrorism increased in the 1960s, driven by nationalist and anti-communist sentiments. During the 1970s, Jewish institutions and representatives became more frequent targets.\nIn the 1990s, a wave of attacks on refugees and migrant workers epitomised a spike in far-right violence in Germany, particularly in eastern regions (Virchow 2022). The total extent of far-right violence during this period is unclear due to inconsistent classification practices1 and under-reporting issues, but official figures from German law enforcement authorities (i.e., Bundeskriminalamt) show a sharp increase in far-right violence. Moreover, places such as Rostock-Lichtenhagen, Solingen, Mölln, and Hoyerswerda witnessed highly visible racist attacks and pogroms.\nSince the reunification of Germany in 1990 various forms of far-right structures have existed in Bavaria, including parties, non-party organisations, associations, and fraternities. Some parties include Die Republikaner, Deutsche Volksunion, and currently the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). There are active movement-parties like the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) (cf. Vollhardt 2024) and Der III. Weg. There are far-right fraternities like the Burschenschaft Danubia München and Teutonia Prag zu Würzburg, which organise events and have links to other far-right organisations. Movement organisations include the AfD’s youth group Junge Alternative (JA) and spin-offs of the Identitarian movement: Requonquista 21, Lederhosen Revolte, and Isar Legion. \nOverall, this overview demonstrates the persistent presence of far-right structures and activity in Bavaria since 1945."

V. (a.i.d.a.) contains data on far-right activities in Bavaria, particularly Munich, extending back decades. The chronology is structured temporally, logging the date of the incident and providing a short description. The aim of this report is to focus on activities from the last year.\nBased on the descriptions, I assigned non-mutually exclusive categorical codes to each incident. Seven categories, inductively drawn from the descriptions, are included:\n\nvandalism: incidents of graffiti, tags, and damage. Stickers, for example, by far-right movements like the Identiterians are also included here;\nparoles: incidents where (often intoxicated) people shouted xenophobic paroles without addressing a specific person;\nsymbols: graffiti and tags that are explicitly forbidden, such as the swastika or SS-runes. It furthermore includes the use of these symbols on apparel or tattoos as well as the use of the Hitlergruß;\nviolence: all physical offences against people, physical attacks and also offences like spitting;\nthreat: all kinds of threats of violence, such as hate-mail addressed to politicians as well as reported digital threats;\ninsult: non-physical attacks against people, like racist, antisemitic, or homophobic insults;\nevents: meetings and non-public assemblies of far-right actors, such as lectures at far-right fraternities.\n\nSeveral categories can apply to one incident: for instance, an incident of vandalism may also involve the use of illegal symbols (e.g., a swastika) and a threat.\nNote that the coding deals with incidents, an occurrence on a particular date, not actors. Sometimes these incidents involve one actor, multiple, or none at all. By coding incidents, it is far-right activity data that is generated. As mentioned above, the last year of activity was coded, June 2023 to May 2024. There are 137 incidents for this period. To these incidents, 232 categories were coded. Together, these data enable a descriptive analysis of far-right activity over the past year.\nA couple limitations to the data deserve mention at the outset. First, the data relies on published reports from police and news services, so they do not reflect all incidents of far-right activity but merely those that are reported on. Someone’s property might be affected by vandalism, for example, and it might not be captured in the data if they do not report it. Second, the data focus on Munich, but also offers coverage of elsewhere in Bavaria. The data do not cover all incidents (again, only those that are reported), but there is probably an under-reporting issue for places outside of Munich. It is not entirely clear from a.i.d.a.’s website hoe they assemble their chronology, but it seems probable that, since the archive is based in Munich and since (more generally) there are more news reports and police coverage in Munich, that the incidents reported are biased towards Munich compared to the rest of Bavaria."

The meeting organised by Reconquista 21 and the Identiterians in Dasing, noted in the Bavarian Verfassungsschutz report, was in the chronology. The other event took place on 23 June in Munich: the fraternity Stauffia organised a summer event that promoted radical libertarian and anti-democratic ideology. Here is a demonstration of the role of fraternities in networking far-right actors. Other agitations like demonstrations, protests, leafletting and petitioning were not recorded in the a.i.d.a. chronology for the past year.\nVandalism accounts for the highest number of incidents in the last year of the a.i.d.a. chronology. This category encompasses a wide range of incidents that demonstrate an obvious far-right motivation, including various forms of graffiti, tags, and damage. This category also includes stickers from far-right groups, which were increasingly found in the south of Munich during the summer of 2023, particularly those bearing the logo of the Identitarian movement.\nCases involving explicitly forbidden NS-symbols, such as the swastika or SS-runes, are recorded under the category of “symbols”. They are indicative of an ideological connection to neo-Nazism. This category also encompasses instances where individuals performed the “Hitlergruß” (‘Hitler greeting’) or displayed NS-symbols in the form of T-shirt prints or tattoos. The frequency of swastika graffiti was striking, highlighting the prevalence of far-right ideologies and symbols in public spaces.\nThe categories “vandalism” and “symbols” together represent a majority of incidents documented by the a.i.d.a. chronology. These two categories provide insight into the extent to which far-right groups or individuals are engaging in destructive behaviour aimed at promoting their ideology or intimidating marginalised communities.\nVerbal attacks, captured by the category “insult,” were also a common occurrence and the third most frequent type of incident. This category includes all forms of discriminatory verbal attacks motivated by racism, homophobia, xenophobia, or antisemitism. In some cases, perpetrators escalated from verbal threats to physical violence.\nIt is important to distinguish between instances where individuals are explicitly targeted with discriminatory language and those where they engage in aimless shouting of slogans, often without addressing a specific person. The category “paroles” was created to capture the latter incident, which includes incidents where individuals, frequently intoxicated or mentally unstable, shout discriminatory phrases without directly targeting anyone.\nThere is thus a meaningful subdivision among the categories: between those covering direct attacks against individuals (insult, threat, violence) and those encompassing instances where far-right actors promote their ideology through more conspicuous signs (vandalism, symbols, events, paroles). These two types of categories likely have different effects on individuals and communities and require distinct measures to prevent and address them. In the case of direct attacks against individuals, swift action is necessary to protect those affected and prevent future occurrences. These incidents can also be linked to other types of far-right activities, such as vandalism. However, monitoring instances where perpetrators draw attention to themselves through more subtle means (vandalism, symbols, events, paroles) is crucial for understanding their motivations and connections to far-right groups or parties or broader far-right ideological strains.\nBy documenting these incidents closely, it becomes possible to identify patterns and trends in far-right activities, which can inform strategies aimed at preventing such incidents and promoting greater safety and inclusivity within communities.\n\nThe course of events\nFigure 1 shows the development of incidents over time. There is a conspicuous rise in incidents of vandalism in August and September 2023. The explanation for this aberrant spike of incidents seems fairly clear: Bavarian regional election took place in September 2023. Several incidents in the run up to the election involved vandalism against election posters. Notably, posters from the Green party were disproportionately targeted by vandals during this period, for example (auto-translated with El-Desouky’s gtranslate package):\n\nMunich. The “B90/The Green” state parliament member Benjamin Adjei reports on several hostility and attacks. Towards the end of July two election posters from Adjei were only lit racist (“N ****, no thanks”). On another poster, a gunshot wound on his face was symbolized with down -flowing blood. Other poster wood stands were also met.

The reasons for this could be many, but Shoshan’s (2016, e.g., p. 97) reflection on the thorough enforcement of laws against proscribed symbols could be instructive for why this crime/incident accounts for such a large number of incidents.\nViolence seem to be rare, accounting for only 18 incidents over the past year—and none since January (as of July 2024). There are no incidents of lethal violence. Several cases involve aggression towards persons with a migration background, for example, an incident from 24 June 2023:\n\nSchweinfurt. A 21 and a 29-year-old offend a 33-year-old man with Rwandian migration history at the main train station on Saturday morning, hit him in the face and throw it with change. The heavily alcoholic men are arrested and displayed. The affected person does not suffer any injuries in need of treatment. Source: Press release from the Lower Franconia police headquarters of June 24, 2023.\n\nAnother such case occurred on 18 December 2023:\n\nMunich. A 73-year-old senior citizen attacks a 31-year-old woman with a Chinese family history at 9:00 a.m. at 9:00 a.m. When the aggressor wants to flee and stands in the way of a 48-year-old, she also puts it on the face. Source: Press release from the Federal Police Directorate in Munich of December 19, 2023.\n\nThis sort of aggression or violence seems to fit with the typical image of far-right violence, that is, motivated by racist or xenophobic attitudes."

    "text": "Conclusions\nIt is essential to note that the data presented and discussed in this report are not representative of all far-right incidents that occurred during this period. The a.i.d.a. chronology includes only a selection of cases, those reported in police statements or public media or reported to a.i.d.a. itself. Consequently, it should be acknowledged that not every incident with a far-right motivation that took place within the last 12 months may be accounted for in this analysis.\nThis report presented a descriptive analysis, noting the prevalence of vandalism and symbol incidents, especially preceding Bavaria’s regional elections. It also noted that recorded incidents of aggression or violence fit the stereotypical image of far-right violence: motivated by racism or xenophobia.\nTo go beyond this reports descriptive analysis would involve the challenging task of determining the underlying motivations behind specific incidents. From a cursory reading of the incident descriptions, it is sometimes difficult to say with certainty whether far-right ideology was the primary driving force behind these events. This is especially so for the “paroles” category of incidents, where individuals engage in discriminatory behaviour while intoxicated or confused.\nDespite these and previously discussed limitations, the data from the a.i.d.a. chronology provide insights into far-right activities in Munich and Bavaria. While much research on the far right in Germany focuses on existing structures and organisations, how they have endured and changed in the post-war era, the a.i.d.a. data reflects activity not organisation or even necessarily organised activity. Most of the incidents make no reference to specific far-right organisations. Instead, the record of incidents are more akin to attitudinal surveys: they show the prevalence of certain attitudes, ideologies, differing from surveys in that the incidents reflect action on behalf of those attitudes.\nThe data from the a.i.d.a. offers ongoing monitoring of far-right activities in Munich and Bavaria, building on research of far-right movements in Germany and Bavaria after 1945 (Manthe 2021). Further research could use this data to examine the interplay between seemingly insignificant events and larger ideological structures and indeed organisational ecologies. Researchers can thereby gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics driving far-right movements in this region."

    "text": "Presentation (Referat)\nStudents that are required by their degree programme to present must give one short (20 minutes maximum) group (2-4 students) presentation of a method of studying social movements.\nA method is a system of data collection and analysis. A presentation of a method should introduce the method, explain how (e.g., for what research topics) it is useful for studying social movements, and (most importantly) discuss at least one example of applied research. For example, a group could present regression analysis by briefly reviewing the logic of regression techniques, explaining that it is useful for detecting correlations in large sets of data, and explaining how Authors X & Y used regression analysis techniques on protest events within a country.\nWhile students may choose any method after conferring with the instructor, the following is a list of some methods that would be suitable for presentation: linear regression, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), network analysis, experimental design, content/discourse analysis, quantitative text analysis, process tracing, spatial analysis, ethnography.\nStudents are responsible for creating their own group and organising their presentation. The date of presentation will be agreed with the instructor and, wherever possible, arranged so that no more than one group presents per class meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria and Indicators\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "section": "Essay (Hausarbeit)",
    "text": "Essay (Hausarbeit)\nStudents that are required by their degree programme to write a final essay will write an analytical data report on a social movement phenomenon, such as protest activity (or in a specific country, or in a sub-national area) or online posting activity by a social movement organisation(s). The report should be 2000-3000 words (excluding citations). It should briefly introduce the subject, briefly discuss relevant research literature, and (particularly important) should gather and present (in a tablular and/or graphic format) some data relevant to understanding the social movement phenomenon (e.g., a report on a social movement group might present protest events associated with that group; or a report on online activity might present the quantity and characteristics of online posts by the platform account associated with a group(s)). Please note that introduction and literature review are to be brief. The intention of this report is for you to gather data and generate analytical insights. Imagine that you are describing this social movement phenomenon to someone (a policymaker or researcher) with no specific knowledge of it; your job is to provide context briefly, offer specific knowledge, and why that knowledge is important.\nStudents are generally free to choose their topic and have it confirmed by the instructor—though the instructor may veto a topic and assign another, or ask the student to choose another. At least one rule applies: no drawing any data from or citing Statista or other data curation services.  Prior to the end of the semester, students intending to write the essay should submit a one-page synopsis that states your topic, lists some relevant research sources, describes the parameters of the data (i.e., variables, number of observations—think of writing up a mini-codebook) and presents a few example rows (i.e., observations), lists any ideas on how to present the data (i.e., how you will visualise it in your report), and identifies any particular points on which you need preliminary feedback. (This is your chance to get risk-free feedback on your work. Embrace it!) Feedback on the synopsis may direct students to revise their topic, focus on other sources, and/or reconsider their data approach to their proposed report.\n\nDeadline for short synopsis submission: 2026-01-17\nDeadline for full report submission (including full dataframe): 2026-03-07\nDue to time constraints, no written preliminary feedback can be provided after the synopsis submission deadline. Students requesting such feedback will receive the following response: “Unfortunately, I am unable to provide feedback at this time. But I suggest you look at the assignment description, the scoring rubric, and the example data report—all provided on the course website.”\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the instructor may accept late submissions of the full report due to unforeseen circumstances. Generally, late submissions will be marked down 0,3 for every two days it is not submitted. If foreseen circumstances make the deadline impossible, please speak to the instructor to make an alternative arrangement.\nAn example data report is provided on this website. It is a slightly modified version of a previous student’s submission and shows an example of a very good data report.\nFinally, a suggested (purely voluntary, but perhaps to your ultimate benefit) mode of conducting work on your report: students may find it advantageous to work in R and Rstudio. This is a powerful data management and analysis tool. It combines the capability to import and visualise data, conduct sophisticated analyses, and even present them in nicely formatted documents (whether Word, PDF, or HTML). Students interested in working with datasets in their theses, going on to advanced academic studies, or pursuing a career in research will benefit enormously from engaging with this tool early and often. The course introduction will provide some tips for using this tool. For further information, please turn to the vast material related to R online or inquire with the instructor. Nevertheless, students are free to work with whatever tools they are most comfortable with, including Microsoft Office programmes.\nOnce you have read this far: please send me an email before second class stating your favourite city and what (if any) politically violent groups you are particularly interested in learning about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria and Indicators\n\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\n- Does the introduction clearly introduce the topic and related data?\n- Does the introduction briefly state any information or context that is essential to understanding the topic and/or data?\n- Does the introduction state the aim of the report?\n- Does the introduction summarise the structure of the report and the main findings?\n\n\n2. Literature and concepts\n- Does the report have a section on relevant literature and concepts related to their topic and data?\n- Does the section provide detailed systematised concept(s) to understand the rest of the data report?\n- Does the section provide the contextual information necessary to understand the rest of the data report?\n\n\n3. Data description\n- Does the data description explain how the data were collected or created?\n- Does the data description report the (most important) variables and overall data structure (e.g., one row is an observation of what)?\nDoes the data description provide any necessary descriptive statistics (e.g., number of observations, range/mean/median, missing observations)?\n- Does the data description reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying source of the data?\n\n\n4. Data presentation\n- Are the data presented in a tabular and graphical format?\n- Is the presentation readable and readily interpretable (e.g., clear labels, legends)?\n- Is the presentation directly connected to the analytical discussion?\n\n\n5. Analytical insights\n- Does the report discuss (descriptive) analytical insights enabled by presentation of the data and closer inspection of certain data points or collections of data points?\n- Is the report cautious about the limits of how much we can interpret the data (e.g., how certain can we be of any trends; how plausible is any speculation about causes?)?\n\n\n6. Conclusion\n- Does the conclusion summarise the report?\n- Does it reflect on the shortcomings or limitations of the data and interpretation?\n- Does it discuss possible ways that this data might be used further (e.g., for thesis research projects, to inform policy discussions)?\n\n\n7. Form\n- Is the report well-organised, logically structured, and easy to follow?\n- Do the different sections clearly, coherently relate to each other?\n- Is the writing clear, with few if any spelling, typological, grammatical, or syntactical errors?\n\n\n8. Data\n- Has the report been submitted with the raw data?\n- Is the data file clear?\n- Would the reader be able to replicate the data report using the data file?"

This begins with understanding that ‘far right’ is a contested term used to describe an indeterminate and diverse set of cases. We will look at how research (and by extension, law and policy) has variously defined far right. We will look at the ideology that serves to motivate organisations and actors we encounter later in the course. This part will help students to evaluate published work on far-right politics and protest, and to situate their own research within relevant conceptual frameworks."

    "text": "PART III - Far-right movements\nIn this set of class sessions, we will shift our focus from political parties to movement actors. To make this transition, we consider the liminal cases that are often called ‘movement-parties’ and, more broadly, consider the relationship between far-right movements and aligned parties. In the sphere of social mobilisation and movement activism, how does far-right activity manifest? Are far-right movements akin to other social movements or some sui generis category? How do other movement actors respond to the far right and to what effect? And why and how do far-right movements falter, fail, and demobilise? These questions take us into a dynamic and highly active field of contemporary research."

How do individuals become involved in far-right activity? What violent manifestations arise from radicalisation into right-wing extremism? And how have new modes of communication and relation on the Internet effected far-right activity? These questions, these classes take up some of the most menacing aspects of the far right and consider whether online tools have significantly changed the conditions of far-right activity."

This consideration goes beyond components of theory, data, methods, and analysis; it extends to thornier issues of ethics and safety. By concluding with these topics, the course will create a space for students to consider how they might conduct their own research into the far right."

    "section": "Examination (Klausur)",
    "text": "Examination (Klausur)\nStudents will not have an examination in this course, but they will in the ‘Einführung Politisches System der BRD’ course. During that examination, they will respond to one of three essay questions based on the content of this course.\n\nInformation on examination\nTypically, the examination is conducted over 90 minutes and will take the following form: for the lecture (‘Einführung Politisches System der BRD’) portion, students will be given five short answer (i.e., one or two paragraphs) questions; they should respond to three of the five. For the seminar (Grundkurs) portion, students will be given three essay prompts and they should respond to one of them.\nFor this course, students might receive an essay prompt like the following: What does the term ‘political opportunity structure’ mean? How does it help us understand how movements emerge and (potentially) have an impact? Discuss with examples.\nA good response to this prompt (and others) would likely consist of four parts: (1) Broad introductory response; (2) Elaborate in (sufficient) detail to answer the questions; (3) Describe examples; (4) Concluding summary.\n\nBroad introductory response, e.g.:\n\nPolitical opportunity structure (POS) refers to availabilities of resources, institutional arrangements, and histories of mobilisation that shape (facilitating/hindering) movement activity. Different aspects of these components are relevant to different movements. But POS in all cases is an important part of explaining if and how movements form, how they operate, and whether and what kinds of impacts they can have. …\n\nElaborate in (sufficient) detail to answer the questions, e.g.:\n\nPOS defines what resources are available for emergent movements to use, whether they can access the public sphere and/or political decision-making, and whether there are viable models of mobilisation and campaigning. While individuals and groups always have some possibility of exercising their agency, the structure referred to by POS is a powerful constraining set of factors. …\n\nDescribe examples, e.g.:\n\nAt a most basic level, POS can refer to the freedom for movements to form, to mobilise and campaign for certain goals. Authoritarian states typically restrict this freedom and offer less space for movements than in liberal democratic states like Germany. Looking closely at specific examples can demonstrate how POS shapes movements. The anti-nuclear movement in Germany, for example, benefited by forming in the wake of 1968-era mobilisations, so models existed for mobilising. Germany’s federal state structure presented more ‘opportunities’ for movements to disrupt implementation of nuclear projects. Critical events, such as Cold War missile installation and the Chernobyl accident, strengthened the movement. And Germany’s (PR) electoral system made the creation of a political party (i.e., institutionalisation and creation of elite allies) a viable option. Germany’s virtually non-existent nuclear power infrastructure is evidence of the anti-nuclear movements success in Germany, contrasted with less successful movement activity in, e.g., France. …\n\nConcluding summary, e.g.:\n\nTo assess whether and in what ways movements can emerge, whether and in what ways movements can have an impact, it is essential to consider relevant POS aspects. Movements exercise their agency within the limitations created by POS."

First, we will look at how the proliferation of online spaces has changed (and not changed) social movement activity. Then, we turn to the outcomes of movements: what impacts, what effects do they have? Correspondingly, we will consider how movements demobilise, whether after successfully achieving their objectives or not. Finally, our last session will focus on some of the largest and most prolific movements in contemporary Germany."
